__Beagle__ is an attempt to create a [genetic algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
that given a set of block functions will compose these blocks in a sequence that
solves a particular task. 

It's possible to solve this problem using sequential or randomised brute force,
however this algorithm strives for a more "intelligent" solution.

(this is my first haskell program so please excuse newbie mistakes.)
